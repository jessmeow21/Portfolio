# Portfolio
This is a showcase of my recent projects: websites/games. Included in my portfolio is my resume and contact. As a web developer, even I ran into a problem in putting together this portfolio. My thought was that if this problem appeared while working on my professional portfolio then I may run into it again for a client's website. 

* **Problem**: Font Awesome Icons lagged and pushed text to the right upon page load. This looks unpolished and distracting. 
* **Solution**: Ruled out every possible reason that this may be happening by playing around with the frameworks and stylesheets. Since that didn't work, I realized the template was using an older version of Font Awesome Icons. After realizing this, I checked the documentation and I copied the correct version link to my html thus solved this problem.
